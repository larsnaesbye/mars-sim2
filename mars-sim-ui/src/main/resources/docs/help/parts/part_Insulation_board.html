<h2>Part : "Insulation board"</h2>
</p><br/>1. Mass Per Unit : 1.0kg<br/><br/>
2. Description :<p><ul><li>
Assume each tile is about 1m x 1m. Each board comprises extruded polystyrene (XPS) 
		and expanded polystyrene insulation (EPS) that contain millions of air pockets trapped 
		within the foam. Because the polystyrene itself is also highly resistant to heat, 
		the result is a great thermal insulator which can give excellent R-ratings. 
		XPS is often lined with aluminium foil. </li></ul></p><br/>
