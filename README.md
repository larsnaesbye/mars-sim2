# mars-sim
*The Mars Simulation Project* is a Java-based [open source](https://opensource.dev/) project that 
simulates the activities of the first generation of settlers on Mars with a higher fidelity of 
modeling and simulation details than a typical PC strategy game. 

---

## Simulation
mars-sim is a **general purpose** simulator depicting the early development of human settlements on Mars.
 
According to *Encyclop√¶dia Britannica*, a computer simulation is the use of a computer to represent 
the dynamic responses of one system by the behavior of another system modeled after it. In essence, 
a simulation is a mathematical description, or model, of a real system in the form of a computer program. 

mars-sim aims to integrate and incorporate as many research disciplines (such as physics, chemistry, 
biology, economics, psychology, and social science) as possible to simulate the dynamics and behaviors 
of people, social structure, physical and mechanical systems, and environment in the context of 
developing human settlements on Mars. 

mars-sim models each settler as an intelligent agent which possess, to varying degrees, autonomy, and mobility. 
It is a symbolic model of reality, given a capacity to learn from experience and an ability to 
cooperate with other agents and systems. A settler has prescribed attributes and skills and makes 
weighted decisions and interacts with one another to produce unexpected results in a sandbox world.

For instance, each settler is assigned with a job, a role, having technical 
[skills](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Skills), [personality traits](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Personality), natural 
[attributes](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Attributes), and preferences of tasks. 
They build [relationship](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Relationship) 
as they interact and work with one another. They are there to live, dream, explore, and settle Mars. 

---

## Operation Modeling
mars-sim depicts near-term human exploration and settlement on Mars. It speaks of a rich scientific 
language selected from research journal and paper in defining operation paradigms and programming models 
that are based on present-day technologies.

For instance, the simulation assumes a low-pressure living environment that facilitates EVA and reduces 
structural requirements on buildings. 

While at the Earth's sea level, the atmospheric pressure is **101 kPa** (14.7 psi) and has 20.9% oxygen, 
in mars-sim, a low pressure atmosphere of **34 kPa** (4.93 psi) is chosen for the settlement living with
the composition of oxygen at 58.8%. However, inside a rover or an 
[EVA suit](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/EVA-Suit), an even lower pressurized 
environment of **17 kPa** (2.47 psi) is adopted for more optimal use of resources and design specifications. 
See [Atmosphere](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Atmosphere) wiki.

Each building has life-support system [functions](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Building-Function)
that continuously monitored and periodically replenished oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water moisture. 
These gases are produced via chemical systems such as **Sabatier Reverse Water Gas (SRWG)**, and 
**Oxygen Generation System (OGS)**, etc.

An example of operation modeling is the sequence of steps involving the ingress and egress of airlocks 
before and after an **Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA)**. 

To walk onto the surface of Mars, a settler must come through an intermediate chamber 
called the *airlock* to exit the settlement. The airlock allows the passage of people between 
a pressure vessel and its surroundings while minimizing the change of pressure in the vessel and loss of 
air from it. In mars-sim, the airlock is a separate building joined to any *Hab* (which stands for cylindrical
*habitation module*) such as *Lander Hab*, or *Outpost Hub*, *Astronomy Observatory*, etc.
All rovers have vehicular airlock built-in. 

---

## Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA)
To perform a team EVA, one of will be selected as the *airlock operator*, who will ensure that proper
procedures be followed before going out for an EVA or after coming back from an EVA.

In case of an egress operation, (1) the airlock would have to be *pressurized*. (2) The air would be heated 
so that the atmospheric pressure and temperature are equalized. (3) Then the airlcok operator would unlock 
and open the inner door. (4) The whole team would enter into the airlock. (5) After all have donned 
EVA suits, the operator will depressurize the chamber and the gases would be re-captured to match the 
outside air pressure. (6) At last, he/she would unlock and open the outer door and the whole team will 
exit to the outside surface of Mars. 

Our third example is the [Radiation Modeling](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Radiation-Exposure),
 which account for how often the **Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR)** and **Solar Energetic Particles (SEP)** 
 would occur during EVA. The cumulative dose is closely monitored in 3 specific exposure interval, 
 namely, the 30-day, the annual and the career lifetime of a settler. It would affect 3 different regions 
 of our body, namely, the *Blood Forming Organs (BFO)*, the *Ocular Lens*, and the *Skin*. The dose limits are
 measured in *milli-Severt*.

## Settlement Development 
One of the goals of mars-sim is to populate the surface of Mars with human settlements.
Each settlement has an initial sponsor to guide its development but will eventually develop 
its own *[command structure](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Role)* and  
*[development objective](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Settlement-Objective)*.  

mars-sim loosely follows the *Mars Direct Mission Plan by Robert Zubrin* and has 6 basic types of 
[settlement templates](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Settlement-Templates) to choose from. 
A 4-settler initial base is called a *Mars Direct Plan (MDP) Phase 1* template. An 8-settler base 
is constructed under *MDP Phase 2* template. A 12-settler base is *MDP Phase 3*. A 24-settler base 
is designated as *Alpha Base*. Besides, players may build a *Trading Outpost* or a *Mining Depot* 
near sites with high mineral concentrations. Depending on its country or origin and/or sponsor, 
each level of template may vary in the numbers and types of building it contains. 

---

## Economics
In terms of [economic](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Economics) modeling, mars-sim implements the 
**Value Point (VP)** system, which keeps track of the supply and demand on each good and resource. 
As there is no standard currency established on Mars yet, settlers barter trades with neighboring settlements 
by keeping track of the credits and deficit based on the VPs of the resources in exchange in each trading session.

---

## Jobs and Missions
Settlers spend much of their time learning to *live off the land*. Assigning meaningful 
[jobs](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Jobs) to the settlers are vital to the health of the economy of 
the settlements. Settlers engage in various [tasks](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Tasks) such as 
maintenance, ensuring life support resources are plentifully supplied, growing food crops in 
[greenhouses](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Greenhouse-Operation), making secondary 
[food products](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Food-Production), and manufacturing needed parts 
and equipment in workshops.

Settlers will also go out on field [Missions](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Missions) to explore and 
study the surrounding landscapes, to prospect and mine minerals, and to trade with neighboring settlements, etc. 
They may even decide to migrate from one settlement to another.

---

## Reliability, Maintenance and Malfunctions
The perils of living on Mars are very real. There is a total of 39 types of [Malfunctions](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Malfunctions) 
that can occur at a given moment. There are 3 metrics
for tracking how reliable a part is, namely, [Reliability](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Reliability) 
percentage, Failure Rate, Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), which are dynamically updated in light of any incidents
that occur during the simulation. Workshops and machinery factories are to produce parts for 
replenishing parts to be used during [Maintenance](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Maintenance) tasks.

---

## Summary
Mars is a harsh world but is certainly less unforgiving than our Moon. Settlers come face-to-face with accidents, 
equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death. Survival depends on how well they work together, 
improve their survival skills and balance individual versus settlement needs.

As the settlers learn how to survive the hardship and build up their settlements, players are rewarded with the 
pure joy of participating in this grand social experiment of creating a new branch of human society on another 
planetary surface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<a href="https://foojay.io/today/works-with-openjdk">
   <img align="right" 
        src="https://github.com/foojayio/badges/raw/main/works_with_openjdk/Works-with-OpenJDK.png"   
        width="100">
</a>

Currently, mars-sim supports Java 11. We will transition to Java 17 as 
JDK 17 is the next long-term support (LTS) release.

* Requires only JRE 11 for running mars-sim
* Requires only JDK 11 (or openjdk 11) for compiling binary

### JDK and JavaFX

Beginning Java 11, the JRE/JDK package is being decoupled from the graphic 
JavaFX API package. 

For the open source community, the OpenJDK is also being decoupled from the OpenJFX.

Currently, mars-sim does not require JavaFX. 

 ```
Note 1 : Specifically, the official release of v3.1.0, v3.2.0 and v3.3.0 of mars-sim do not 
utilize JavaFX / OpenJFX. Therefore, it's NOT a requirement to install them.
 ```
 
However, if you want to run any JavaFX apps, make sure you also download and 
configure the OpenJFX or JavaFX package on top of the JDK. 

See ticket #156 to read the discussions on how to set up JavaFX to run it 
under Java 11.



You may go to [Bellsoft site](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#/java-16-current) to 
obtain the latest Liberica JDK for your platform. 

We recommend downloading the `Full JDK` 64 bits JDK. 

`Full JDK` includes LibericaFX, which is based on OpenJFX, for 
running other apps that requires JavaFX.

For windows platform, choose MSI version that will automatically set up the environment path.


### OS Platforms

Assuming that OpenJDK 11 is being used

#### Linux

1. The debian edition of mars-sim comes with debian installer for quick installation. However, 
you will have to install, configure and properly update the JDK or openJDK binary in your linux
 machine in order to run mars-sim. Please google to find out the most updated instructions for your distro.

2. To manage multiple versions of java with the use of a tool called `SDKMan`, 
see this [DZone article](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-install-multiple-versions-of-java-on-the-sa).

#### macOS

1.  Check if the directory of JDK is at `Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home`. 
See [DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/installing-openjdk-11-on-macos) for more instructions.

2. Enter `/usr/libexec/java_home -V` to find out which version of Java you have installed.


#### Windows
 
1. Start a command prompt and type this `set PATH="C:\Program Files\Java\jre-11.0.12\bin";%PATH%`.

2. Alternatively, pre-set the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` in *Environment Variables* in Control Panel. 
   
  a. Add `C:\Program Files\Java\jre-11.0.12\bin` to the `PATH` variable. 
 ```
Note 2 : The order of precedence inside `PATH` is crucial. The first available folder having Java 
executable inside will be the one to be loaded by Windows OS. 
 ```
  b. Set `JAVA_HOME` to a JRE or JDK's destination such as `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.12\bin\` or 
`C:\Program Files\Java\jre-11.0.12\bin`. 
 
  ```
Note 2a : The `\bin` is crucial. When running `java -jar xxxx.jar`, mars-sim will look for the 
presence of the `java.exe` in Windows OS. If `\bin` is missing in the `JAVA_HOME` variable, 
the Windows OS may not be able to locate the `java.exe` and may continue to go down the `PATH` 
variable to look for a valid JDK folder. If it's not found, java cannot start mars-sim. 
 ```
 
  c. Add `%JAVA_HOME%;` to `PATH`. Type "path" in a command prompt to double check 
the order of precedence when it comes to searching for the JDK. 

 ```
Note 3 : The BEST approach is to enable only one Java build (such as Java 11.0.12) 
inside `PATH` and remove all other folders referencing other java versions/builds.
 ```
3. Remove any path similar to `C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;`  in `PATH` variable. It can 
interfere with the correct version of Java that you would like to use. 
 ```
Note 4 : Depending on the order of precedence in Path variable, 
`C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath` can load the undesired version of jre/jdk,
instead of the java version you prefer.
 ```
4. To test the version of Java that your machine is using, type "java -version"
in a command prompt window.

5. It's very typical for a machine to have multiple versions of Java installed.
To check if a particular Oracle version of Java is being *enabled*, 
start [Java Control Panel (JCP)](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/win_controlpanel.html) 
from the Control Panel as follows :  

* Move your mouse to the magnifier icon (the 2nd icon from the left) on win 10 task bar. 
* Type `Configure Java`. 
* Hover your mouse over the `Configure Java` and click to start the `Java Control Panel`.
* Click on `Java` tab on top.
* Click on `View` button to open up another panel window.
* Click on the checkbox on the `Enable` column to enable or disable any installed versions of Java.
 ```
Note 5. In JCP, each row represents a version of Java. Unfortunately, this panel
only tracks the official Oracle versions. If you install any openJDK's on 
your machine, JCP won't be able to recognize them.
 ```
 
6. To track what versions of openjdk have been installed on your machine. 
Use [JDKMon](https://harmoniccode.blogspot.com/2021/04/friday-fun-lxiii-jdkmon.html)
