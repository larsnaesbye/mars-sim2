# mars-sim

The Mars Simulation Project is a Java based open source project that simulates the activities of the first generation of settlers on Mars in a virtual environment. Each agent has various human-like characteristics, capable of making distinct decisions on a virtual Mars and interacting with one another. 


## Modeling and Simulation

As a social simulation, mars-sim models in terms of a settler's career type, job role, technical skills, personality and temperament and relationship with one another as they go about their day-to-day lives. 

Player can create numerous settlements spreading across Mars, from a simple 4-person initial landing site, a mining site to more matured bases hosting higher functions. 

These settlements have command structures, their own goals, and can trade with one another. 


## Tasks and Missions

At the base construction phase, most settlers will spend much of their time learning to "live off the land". They will be busy in maintenance, growing crops in greenhouses, and manufacturing needed parts and equipment from collected local resources. 

Settlers will also go out on rover missions to explore and study surrounding areas, prospect and mine mineral concentrations, and trade with neighboring settlements. 


## Contribution and Feedback

Mars is a harsh world but is certainly less unforgiving than our Moon. Settlers come face-to-face with accidents, equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death. Survival depends on how well they work together, improve their survival skills and balance individual vs. settlement needs.

We welcome anyone who would like to contribute mars-sim in coding or artwork/sounds or simply drop in your ideas and provide us your feedback.
