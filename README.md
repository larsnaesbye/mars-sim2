# mars-sim

The Mars Simulation Project is a free Java software project that creates a simulation of future human settlement of Mars. 

It is a social simulation, modeling the human behavior of scientists, engineers, doctors, technicians, etc. as they go about their day-to-day lives in the virtual Martian environment. 

There are many different settlements spread out across the planet, ranging from simple 4-person initial landing habitats to more mature bases hosting dozens of people and advanced buildings. 

Settlers spend much of their time maintaining their settlements, growing crops in their greenhouses, and manufacturing needed parts and equipment from collected local resources. 

Settlers also go out on rover missions to explore and study the surrounding area, prospect and mine mineral concentrations, and trade with their neighboring settlements. 

Mars is a harsh and dangerous world, and the settlers have to contend with accidents, equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death. 

Survival depends on the settlers working together, building relationships, improving skills and balancing the needs of their settlements.

Since MSP is an openly-developed project, we welcome anyone who would like to contribute code, artwork, sounds, or simply ideas and provides us your feedback.
