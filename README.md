# mars-sim

The Mars Simulation Project is a Java based open source project that simulates the activities of the first generation of settlers on Mars in a virtual environment. Each agent has various human-like characteristics, capable of making distinct decisions on a virtual Mars and interacting with one another on the surface of Mars.


## Modeling and Simulation

As a semi-social simulation, mars-sim models mostly the professional interaction between the settlers in terms of their career type, job role, technical skills, personality, natural attribute, prior trainings, and relationship with one another as they strive on Mars.

Player may create numerous settlements spreading across the surface of Mars such as a simple 4-person initial landing base, a mining site, or a more self-contained settlement hosting higher functions. 

Each settlement has a command structure, a developmental objective, and it's only internal checks and balances to set the Value Points (VP) of each resources 


## Tasks and Missions

Initially most settlers will spend much of their time learning to "live off the land". They will be busy in maintenance, ensuring life support resources are well balanced, growing crops in greenhouses, and manufacturing needed parts and equipment in workshops. 

Settlers will also go out on rover missions to explore and study surrounding landscapes, prospect and mine minerals, and trade with neighboring settlements via trading missions. 


## Summary

Mars is a harsh world but is certainly less unforgiving than our Moon. Settlers come face-to-face with accidents, equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death. Survival depends on how well they work together, improve their survival skills and balance individual vs. settlement needs.
