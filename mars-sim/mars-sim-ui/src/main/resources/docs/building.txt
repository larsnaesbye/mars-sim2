The Mars Simulation Project can be built in several ways.

** Ant build tool **

The preferred way to build the project is using the Ant build tool and 
the build.xml file in the scripts subdirectory.

Ant can be freely downloaded here: http://ant.apache.org

Ant can be used by going to the scripts subdirectory of the Mars Simulation 
Project and typing: ant <target> 

The following targets are available in the project's build.xml file:

compile: Compiles the source code but doesn't build the JAR files.

build: Compiles the source code and builds the JAR files.

clean-build: Deletes all the old class and JAR files and builds the project.

test: Performs a unit test on the project.
      
document: Creates JavaDoc documentation for the project in the docs directory.
