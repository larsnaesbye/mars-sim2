growing-time : # of sols
crop-category : crop type
edible-biomass : in tonnes per hectare  or  gram / m^2 / day
edible-water-content : in proportion of 1 (1 is 100%)
inedible-biomass : in tonnes per hectare
daily-PAR : in mol /  m^2 / day

Note: 1 metric ton = 1 tonnes

8.  Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which is light with a wavelength
between 300/400 to 700 nm

Researchers measure instantaneous light in micromoles (μmol) per square
meter (m-2) per second (s-1), or: μmol·m-2·s-1 of PAR. This “quantum” unit quantifies the number of
photons (individual particles of energy) used in photosynthesis that fall on a square meter (10.8
square feet) every second.

This light measurement is an instantaneous reading.

Daily light integral (DLI) or Daily PAR is the amount of PAR received
each day as a function of light intensity (instantaneous light: μmol·m-2·s-1) and duration (day). It is expressed
as moles of light (mol) per square meter (m-2) per day (d-1), or: mol·m-2·d-1 (moles per day).
The DLI concept is like a rain gauge. Just as a rain gauge collects the total rain in a particular location over
a period of time, so DLI measures the total amount of PAR received in a day. Greenhouse growers can use
light meters to measure the number of light photons that accumulate in a square meter over a 24-hour period.

10.  Total water use and water requirement:
soybean: total: 845 kg, req :  414 kg per gram....

11. MPR Model: a crop model that consists of a set of nonlinear polynomial equations, six for each crop, developed using multivariate polynomial regression
(MPR).

The dependent variables for three of the six MPR equations are the relative growth rates
of (a) total dry mass prior to formation of yield bearing organs, (b) total dry mass after the
formation of yield bearing organs, and (c) yield dry mass.

The independent variables used in each equation include the average PPF, T, and CO2 values (averaged from planting date up to
the current time increment t), and the total or yield dry mass at t-1.

The model-based predictive controller adjusts light intensity, atmospheric/elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration,
(photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), average daily air temperature (T),
