	Since the wind has gathered them together, they do not even have to be 
	mined, merely scooped up.These minerals could supply future colonists 
	with chromium, iron, and titanium.

    http://en.wiki2.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment : Nitrification itself is a two-step aerobic process, each step facilitated by a different type of bacteria. The oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2−) is most often facilitated by Nitrosomonas spp. ("nitroso" referring to the formation of a nitroso functional group). Nitrite oxidation to nitrate (NO3−), though traditionally believed to be facilitated by Nitrobacter spp. (nitro referring the formation of a nitro functional group), is now known to be facilitated in the environment almost exclusively by Nitrospira spp.
